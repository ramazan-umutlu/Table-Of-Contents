# Table-Of-Contents
Automated table of contents script. Written light-weight with jquery. You will generate TOC for all your articles with a single code without slowing down your site.

It will automatically add all the H2 tags in the HTML Article tag into the Table Of Contents section. If you want to add the H3's, you can add them with a small change in the code.
